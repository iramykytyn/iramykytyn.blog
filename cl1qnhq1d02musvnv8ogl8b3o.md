## How to set up monitoring of CPU and memory usage for C++ multithreaded application with Prometheus, Grafana, and Process Exporter

Have you ever wondered how to know how much CPU and memory resources is your app taking during a week? Or how to collect and visualize this data to get some useful insights? In this guide, I will show you how to do it with Grafana, Prometheus, and possibly minor updates to your C++ app.

> üí° This was tested on Ubuntu 20.04 on x86_64 and aarch64 architectures.


## Tools Setup

### Install Prometheus
Following Prometheus official setup guide: [https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps/](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps/).
```bash
wget https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v2.33.1/prometheus-2.33.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar xvfz prometheus-2.33.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
cd prometheus-2.33.1.linux-amd64
./prometheus
```
You should be able to load Prometheus UI at [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090/metrics).

### Install Process Exporter
[Process-exporter](https://github.com/ncabatoff/process-exporter) - is a Prometheus exporter that mines /proc to report on selected processes.

```
wget https://github.com/ncabatoff/process-exporter/releases/download/v0.7.10/process-exporter-0.7.10.linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar xvzf process-exporter-0.7.10.linux-amd64.tar.gz
cd process-exporter-0.7.10
```

Run process exporter specifying your process name

```
./process-exporter-0.7.10 -procnames <your_app_name>
```

You will see the following printout where you could also have a look at the metrics for your process via [http://localhost:9256/metrics](http://localhost:9090/metrics).

### Configure Prometheus to digest metrics from process-exporter
Open ```prometheus.yml``` in ```./prometheus-...``` root folder. Add ```process-exporter``` to scrape configs:

```
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "process-exporter"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["localhost:9256"]
```

Restart Prometheus: 

```
./prometehus --config.file="./prometheus.yml"
```

### Install Grafana
Follow [Grafana Install Guide](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/installation/debian/) for more information. Or you can also use Grafana Cloud solution, please go [here](https://grafana.com/products/cloud/?plcmt=footer) for instructions.

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install grafana-enterprise
sudo systemctl start grafana-server
```

Check out [http://localhost:3000](about:blank). By default credentials are ```admin```:```admin``` credentials.

### Configure Grafana to use Prometheus as a data source
Go to the Data sources in Configuration and add Prometheus as a data source. Set URL for this data source to [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090/metrics).

Watch this guide about [Getting started with Grafana](https://grafana.com/go/webinar/getting-started-with-grafana/?pg=docs-grafana&plcmt=footer-resources-1) for more details.


## Example of usage

Imagine we have a simple C++ application. The app creates 4 threads and printout messages in while loops with some random sleeps. We wanna visualize how much CPU each thread is taking, and how much memory the whole process need for execution over an hour.

### sample_app.cpp

```—Å++
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <thread>

void print(int n, const std::string &str){
  unsigned run_times = 1000000;  
	while(run_times) {
    std::string msg = std::to_string(n) + " : " + str;
    std::cout << msg  << std::endl;
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::microseconds(run_times/100));
    --run_times; 
  }
}

int main(){
	std::vector<std::string> s = {
	    "message 0",
	    "message 1",
	    "message 2", 
	    "message 3"  
	};  
	std::vector<std::thread> threads;
	  for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++){
	    threads.push_back(std::thread(print, i, s[i]));
		}

   for(auto &th : threads){
		  th.join();  
	 }

  return 0;
}
```

Compiled and executed it. We should be able to see ```namedprocess_namegroup_thread_cpu_seconds_total``` in Prometheus prompt:

Wondering why there is only one thread name, while we were expected to see 4 threads, besides the main process thread?
That‚Äôs because we need to give a proper name to the threads.
Let‚Äôs check it out with htop:

```
htop -p $(pgrep -d',' -f ./sample_app)
```

![Screenshot 2022-04-02 at 15.16.34.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1649431291364/z1zQ1yrZK.png)

In order to be able to distinguish threads, we need to give them names. I used ```prctl``` system function for this.

```
#include <sys/prctl.h>

void print(int n, const std::string &str){ 
	unsigned run_times = 1000000;
	std::string thread_name = "thread-" + std::to_string(n);
  prctl(PR_SET_NAME, thread_name.c_str(), 0, 0, 0);  

	while(run_times) {...}

}
...
```

Now it‚Äôs better:

The next step is to visualize these metrics in Grafana and PromQL (read about PromQL [here](https://timber.io/blog/promql-for-humans/) and [here](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/)).

### Explore
Go to Explore section in Grafana and run the query ```rate(namedprocess_namegroup_thread_cpu_seconds_total{mode="system", groupname="sample_app"}[5m])```. Observing separate threads may be useful if you wanna see optimisation gups.

### Visualize other useful data about your process
Use predefined Grafana dashboard to visualize CPU, memory usage, read/write bytes of your process: [https://grafana.net/dashboards/249](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/249). Just import it to Grafana.

Don‚Äôt know what Resident and Virtual memory mean on this dashboard? In my next article, I will talk about Linux memory, follow me so don‚Äôt miss this and other blog posts.
